## Reporting bugs
Bug reports are the easiest contributions one can do, and maybe the most important ones.

this is really an issue caused by a bug in gramhopper.

When reporting a bug, please provide as much information as possible, to help us identify and solve it easily.
Please follow the bug report template (which appears when creating an issue) and fill all applicable fields

## Adding documentation
Adding documentation is a great way to contribute, too!

Our documentation is built using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
It is based on RST files located in [`docs/`](https://github.com/OrBin/gramhopper/tree/dev/docs/source) directory, and on docstrings in the python code.<br>
Find [here](https://github.com/OrBin/gramhopper/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation+) issues related to documentation.

#### Building the documentation
Run `invoke build-docs` to build the documentation.<br>
The build output will be in `docs/build` directory.<br>
Run `invoke clean --docs` to clear the documentation build outputs.

## Code of conduct
